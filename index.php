<i> Children’s rights are human rights. <br>
Children must be treated with equality,<br>
respect and dignity, not because they are <br>
“the future” or the “adults of tomorrow”, <br>
but because they are human beings <br>
today. All humans are born inherent with <br>
fundamental freedoms and rights. <br> <br>

Children must enjoy the same human <br>
rights as everybody else—from the right <br>
to freedom of expression to the right to <br>
privacy. This means all human rights laws <br>
apply equally to children and adults. </i> </font> </table> </td>

<b> <i> Hope is a feeling of optimism or a <br>

Hope is defined as the action of <br>
